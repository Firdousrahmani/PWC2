During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on a business-critical project for a telecom client, focused on understanding and
improving customer retention. The objective was to build a Power BI dashboard that could help the retention team quickly identify churn
drivers and take informed action.

The project began with a detailed requirement brief from the Retention Manager, which included:

‚Ä¢ Data on customers who had left within the last month

‚Ä¢ Services subscribed by each customer (phone, internet, streaming, etc.)

‚Ä¢ Customer account details like contract type, payment method, tenure, and billing details

‚Ä¢ Demographic information such as gender, age, and partner/dependent status

I designed and delivered an interactive dashboard titled "Churn & Retention Overview", structured to bring clear visibility into churn behavior
and help the business identify  insights.

üîç Key Insights from My Analysis:

‚Ä¢ Fiber Optic internet users accounted for the highest churn ‚Äî highlighting a potential issue in service delivery or customer expectations.

‚Ä¢ Customers paying via Electronic Check had the highest churn rate, suggesting a need to encourage automated payment methods.

‚Ä¢ Churn rates were significantly higher among new customers, emphasizing the importance of strong onboarding and early engagement strategies.

‚Ä¢ Tenure showed an inverse relationship with churn ‚Äî the longer a customer stayed, the less likely they were to leave.

‚Ä¢ Demographic analysis revealed additional patterns in churn behavior based on gender and partner status, enabling more targeted retention campaigns.


This dashboard not only simplified complex data into a decision-ready format but also helped the retention team prioritize customer segments that needed immediate attention.
